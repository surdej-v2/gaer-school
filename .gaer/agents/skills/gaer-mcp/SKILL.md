name: gaer-mcp
description: The two MCP servers in Gær — /mcp for the app (acts as the user, own data) and /mcp/admin for admin (admin role, every change is a draft). Use when adding or changing an MCP tool, the OAuth flow, drafts or deep links.

# MCP servers (gaer-mcp)

Contract: `specs/mcp/SPEC.md`. Tools: `specs/mcp/catalog.json` — add a tool there first; a test fails if
the registered tools and the catalog differ. Code: `server/app/mcp/`.

| | `/mcp` | `/mcp/admin` |
|---|---|---|
| Who | full session | `role = 'admin'`, not a test account, not impersonating; consent needs a fresh second factor |
| Data | caller's own rows only | whole instance |
| Writes | own data directly; delete/export → draft | always draft → `confirm_draft` |

## Files
| File | What |
| --- | --- |
| `oauth.py` | well-known metadata, `/mcp/register`, `/mcp/authorize` → `/forbind` (consent), `/mcp/token`; a client is a `sessions` row (`mcp_client_id`, `mcp_scope`), so /konto, block and revoke end it |
| `transport.py` | Streamable HTTP with the `mcp` SDK (pinned); bearer → `Caller` on the ASGI scope; role re-checked per request |
| `registry.py` | loads `catalog.json` (copy of the spec's), `@tool` / `@draft`, `invoke()` — the one entry point, logs to `mcp_log` |
| `drafts.py` | `mcp_drafts`, `confirm_draft` / `cancel_draft` / `list_drafts`; confirm re-plans and compares `state_hash` |
| `app_server.py`, `admin_server.py`, `db_tools.py` | the tools; `db_query` runs as `<db>_mcp_ro` (`MCP_DB_QUERY_URL`) |
| `links.py`, `app_map.json` | deep links `/go?path=…&focus=…` / `/admin/go`, only if path + anchor are in the map |
| `hub.py` | `/api/admin/mcp/*` for the hub at `/admin/mcp` (overview, tools, invoke, drafts, events, SSE stream); confirming a draft there uses `require_admin_stepup` |

## Login and MFA (skill `gaer-auth`)
- The consent page `/forbind` uses the normal login: e-mail + code, and the second factor when the user's rules ask
  for one. A pending `mfa` session cannot consent.
- `mcp:admin` is only granted right after a second factor (`mfa_at` within `STEPUP_MINUTES`, else `403` +
  `X-Gaer-Error: stepup_required` — the app's step-up dialog handles it). The token then lives for weeks, so this is
  the moment MFA is checked; admin tools reuse the `/api/admin` helpers (`do_*`) with the same rules (super admin,
  last admin, who may reset whom).
- Profile and security tools: `/mcp` has `profile_get`, `profile_update` (name, language, time zone) and the
  read-only `security_get`; `/mcp/admin` has `user_get` (incl. MFA status), and the drafts `user_profile_set` and
  `user_reset_mfa`. Factors are never added or removed over MCP — that needs the browser (WebAuthn) and a second
  factor; link to `/konto#sikkerhed`.

## Files (skill `gaer-storage`, `server/app/filetree.py`)
- `/mcp`: `files_browse`, `file_read`, `file_write`, `folder_create`, `file_move` on the caller's home (`~/`) and
  `/shared/`; `file_delete` is a draft. `/mcp/admin`: `files_browse`, `file_read`, `file_link` on the whole tree;
  `file_write`, `folder_create`, `file_move`, `file_delete`, `folder_delete` are drafts. All go through `filetree`
  (same rules and audit rows as `/api/files` and `/admin/files`); links open `/admin/files?folder=…`.

## Adding a tool
- Add it to `specs/mcp/catalog.json` and copy the file to `server/app/mcp/catalog.json`.
- Read or write tool: `@tool("app", "name") async def run(args, caller) -> ToolOutput(data, links, text)`.
  App tools filter on `caller.user_id`; writes call `audit()` in the same transaction.
- Draft tool: `@draft("admin", "name") async def plan(args, caller, conn) -> DraftPlan(summary, impact, state, execute)`.
  `plan` must not change anything; `execute(conn)` runs in the confirm transaction next to the audit row.
- Raise `ToolError("…")` for a Danish message to the user. Names and descriptions are English.
- Give it a `link` in the catalog when a screen exists, add the `data-deeplink` anchor on that screen and run
  `npm run app-map --prefix web` (the build fails with `--check` when a catalog link has no anchor).

## Never
- A new login path — MCP authorizes through the normal login (code, second factor where required).
- Tools that add or remove passkeys, security keys or authenticator apps, or switch "Kræv passkey" on or off.
- App tools that read or write another user's rows.
- Tools that grant admin to yourself, write SQL, touch log tables or return a session token.
